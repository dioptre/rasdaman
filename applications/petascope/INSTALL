This file contains instructions on how to install PetaScope.

BUILD AND INSTALL:

- PetaScope is part of rasdaman (www.rasdaman.org), to get it use:

   $ git clone git://kahlua.eecs.jacobs-university.de/rasdaman.git
	  
- Setup the database
   1. Create database petascopedb in PostgreSQL, with user petauser/petapasswd, or
   2. Copy the src/main/resources/settings.properties configuration file to
      db/settings.properties and adapt the metadata_* fields
      
- Make sure that the local user running the make command is defined in PostgreSQL
  and can modify the petascope database
  
- Do everything in one step:

    $ make all
	  
  This compiles the code, creates a war archive in build/dist and Javadoc in
  build/apidocs and creates/updates the database.
  
- Deploy the war file build/dist/petascope.war, with Tomcat. If CATALINA_HOME
  is properly set to the Tomcat's home directory, you can also do:
  
    $ make install
     
- The petascope interface will then be available at http://localhost/petascope
	An interface more specific to WCPS can be accessed at	http://localhost/petascope/wcps

Please note that in order for PetaScope to run, you also need a 
rasdaman server available. You can download and install it from
www.rasdaman.org/Download

VERSION COMPATIBILITY STATEMENT:

Petascope compiles successfully with Java 1.6.

# start_rasdaman.sh - start rasdaman server complex
#
# SYNTAX
#	start_rasdaman.sh [servers...]
#
# DESCRIPTION
#	This script starts rasdaman.
#	Which rasdaman servers are started depends on the 'server' name(s) provided:
#	* If no server name is provided then the environment variable $RASSERVERS is
#	  inspected to obtain a list of servers to be started. If $RASSERVERS is not
#	  set, then all rasdaman servers defined will be attempted to start.
#	* If at least one parameter is provided then all parameters 
#	  will be treated as a server name which is tried to be started.
#
#	One possible reason while not all servers may come up is that more servers
#	might be defined than your licence model allows to run in parallel.
#
#	To log in to the server, the external variable $RASLOGIN is expected to hold
#	an ID string (see rasdaman manual). If not found, a desperate last attempt is 
#	made to login as rasadmin/rasadmin. If this fails, no servers are started at all.
#
# PRECONDITIONS
#	- need to have a rasdaman admin login either from $RASLOGIN or as rasadmin/rasadmin
#	- need to run with an effective user id that allows to write into log/
#	- need to have a valid rasdaman installation
#
# RETURN CODES
	RC_OK=0		# everything went fine
	RC_ERROR=1	# something went wrong

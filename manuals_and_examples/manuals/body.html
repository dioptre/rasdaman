This is the documentation of <i>rasdaman community</i>, a free, open-source middleware extending standard relational database systems with the ability to efficiently query and manipulate multi-dimensional arrays of unlimited size.
Such arrays are also called "raster data", "gridded data", etc. depending on the application domain.
